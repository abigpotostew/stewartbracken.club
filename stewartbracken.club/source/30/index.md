## Where
Laguna Creek Beach, Santa Cruz

Just before Panther Beach when driving north on 1. Park at the lot at Laguna Road and Highway 1. Walk down the trail across from the parking lot to the beach and look for me.

## Also
* Wear a costume!
* But it's a nude beach so costumes optional.
* It will probably be chilly so practice wim hof :) Or bring warm clothes.
* I will have a gas stove and some food to share. It would be wonderful if you brought food to share.
* There's no bathroom here but plenty of private nature nooks 😉. I will bring TP.


## On the global thing
Please don't come if you're not feeling well or have been exposed. And if you prefer to social distance, bring your own blanket and supplies.
