Morning pages are foundational for me. I handwrite 3 pages, flow of consciousness, first thing in the morning. Before I look at my phone, before reading anything, before plugging in for the day. I allow my subconscience to express whatever it needs without judgement. If I want to complain and be in victim mode for 3 pages. I allow myself. If I want to plan out my day and get excited about what is to come, I allow myself. It's all allowed in morning pages. It's allows me to organize my thoughts. It gets out some of the nasty thoughts so I don't dwell on them during the day. Morning pages are always revealing. If something keeps coming up, well, that something is knocking at my door and wanting to be addressed. It also often leans towards motivating and uplifting myself.
