I am Stewart Bracken and I do programming professionally. I specialize in backend matters such as rest API, persistence, and aws cloud architecture in java and more recently go. I also enjoy running, reading, cooking, video games, and spending time with my gal pal Sophia. We enjoy hiking and playing with our cat zizi.
